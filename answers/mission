Write notes about how you would debug here. 3_1.txt

1. Customer error #1: He did not see the transaction in the ui
	- I would first check the obvious. Look at the UI and see if the transaction in question is indeed missing.

2. Customer error # 2: He did not actually make the transfer
	- If it is missing from the UI, then I would wonder if the customer actually made the transfer. I would contact the bank and check if indeed they did receive the transfer.

3. Bank API error : the bank received the transfer, but their API data was bad

4. It's indeed a technical problem on our end, and we need to investigate
